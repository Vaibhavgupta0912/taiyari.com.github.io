          <h1 id="demo" class="animate__animated animate__zoomIn" style="animation-delay: 1s;">Core Java: Basics of Java Interview Questions</h1>
          
          <h2 id="question">1)   What is Java?</h2>
          <p id="answer"> Java is the high-level, object-oriented, robust, secure programming language, platform-independent, high performance, Multithreaded, and portable programming language. It was developed by James Gosling in June 1991. It can also be known as the platform as it provides its own JRE and API.</p>

          <h2 id="question">2)   List the features of Java Programming language.?</h2>
            <p id="answer"> There are the following features in Java Programming Language.
              <br>
               <br>
               <b> Simple:</b> Java is easy to learn. The syntax of Java is based on C++ which makes easier to write the  program in it.
              
               <br>
              <br>
              <b> Object-Oriented:</b>   Java follows the object-oriented paradigm which allows us to maintain our code as the combination of different type of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.
             
              <br>
              <br>
               <b> Portable:</b>   Java supports read-once-write-anywhere approach. We can execute the Java program on every machine. Java program (.java) is converted to bytecode (.class) which can be easily run on every machine.
              
              <br>
              <br>
               <b> Platform Independent:</b>   Java is a platform independent programming language. It is different from other programming languages like C and C++ which needs a platform to be executed. Java comes with its platform on which its code is executed. Java doesn't depend upon the operating system to be executed.
              
              <br>
              <br>
               <b>Secured:</b>  Java is secured because it doesn't use explicit pointers. Java also provides the concept of ByteCode and Exception handling which makes it more secured.
              
               <br>
              <br>
               <b> Robust:</b>  Java is a strong programming language as it uses strong memory management. The concepts like Automatic garbage collection, Exception handling, etc. make it more robust.
              
               <br>
              <br>
               <b> Architecture Neutral:</b>  Java is architectural neutral as it is not dependent on the architecture. In C, the size of data types may vary according to the architecture (32 bit or 64 bit) which doesn't exist in Java.
              
               <br>
              <br>
              <b>Interpreted:</b>   Java uses the Just-in-time (JIT) interpreter along with the compiler for the program execution.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>High Performance: </b>   Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is "close" to native code. It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++).
              
              <br>
              <br>
              <b> Multithreaded:</b>   We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>  Distributed:</b> Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java. RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications. This feature of Java makes us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              <b> Dynamic:</b>  Java is a dynamic language. It supports dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C and C++.</p>

            <h2 id="question">4)   What do you understand by Java virtual machine?</h2>
              <p id="answer"> Java Virtual Machine is a virtual machine that enables the computer to run the Java program. JVM acts like a run-time engine which calls the main method present in the Java code. JVM is the specification which must be implemented in the computer system. The Java code is compiled by JVM to be a Bytecode which is machine independent and close to the native code.</p>

            <h2 id="question">5)   What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?</h2>
                <p id="answer"><b style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;"> JVM </b> 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  JVM is an acronym for Java Virtual Machine; it is an abstract machine which provides the runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It is a specification which specifies the working of Java Virtual Machine. Its implementation has been provided by Oracle and other companies. Its implementation is known as JRE.
                  <br>
                  JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (so JVM is platform dependent). It is a runtime instance which is created when we run the Java class. There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;"> JRE </b> 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is the implementation of JVM. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                <b style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;"> JDK </b> 
                <br>
                <br>
                JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. It is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools. JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:
                <ul id="subpoints">
                  <li >Standard Edition Java Platform</li>
                  <li >Enterprise Edition Java Platform</li>
                  <li >Enterprise Edition Java Platform</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              
            <h2 id="question">6)   How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?</h2>
            <p id="answer"> Many types: </p>
              <ol id="points">
                <li> <b>Class(Method) Area: </b> Class Area stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant pool, field, method data, and the code for methods.</li>
                <br>
                <li> <b>Heap: </b> It is the runtime data area in which the memory is allocated to the objects</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Stack: </b> Java Stack stores frames. It holds local variables and partial results, and plays a part in method invocation and return. Each thread has a private JVM stack, created at the same time as the thread. A new frame is created each time a method is invoked. A frame is destroyed when its method invocation completes.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Program Counter Register: </b> PC (program counter) register contains the address of the Java virtual machine instruction currently being executed.</li>
                <br>
              
                <li><b>Native Method Stack: </b> It contains all the native methods used in the application.</li>
              </ol>
            

            <h2 id="question">7)   What is JIT compiler?</h2>
              <p id="answer"> Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler: It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of the bytecode that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation. Here the term “compiler” refers to a translator from the instruction set of a Java virtual machine (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.</p>
             
           <h2 id="question">8)   What is the platform?</h2>
                <p id="answer"> A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a piece of software is executed. There are two types of platforms, software-based and hardware-based. Java provides the software-based platform.</p>
              
          <h2 id="question">9)  What are the various access specifiers in Java?</h2>
                  <p id="answer"> In Java, access specifiers are the keywords which are used to define the access scope of the method, class, or a variable. In Java, there are four access specifiers given below.</p>
                  <ul id="subpoints">
                    <li ><b>Public</b> Public The classes, methods, or variables which are defined as public, can be accessed by any class or method. </li>
                   <br> <li ><b>Protected</b> Protected can be accessed by the class of the same package, or by the sub-class of this class, or within the same class</li>
                   <br> <li ><b>Default</b> Default are accessible within the package only. By default, all the classes, methods, and variables are of default scope.</li>
                   <br> <li><b>Private</b> The private class, methods, or variables defined as private can be accessed within the class only.</li>
                  </ul>

                  
          <h2 id="question">10)   What is the purpose of static methods and variables?</h3>
                    <p id="answer"> The methods or variables defined as static are shared among all the objects of the class. The static is the part of the class and not of the object. The static variables are stored in the class area, and we do not need to create the object to access such variables. Therefore, static is used in the case, where we need to define variables or methods which are common to all the objects of the class.
                      <br><br>
                      For example, In the class simulating the collection of the students in a college, the name of the college is the common attribute to all the students. Therefore, the college name will be defined as static</p>
          

          <h2 id="question">11)   What is the output of the following Java program?</h2>          
          <div class="program">
            class Test   <br>
             {  <br>
                 public static void main (String args[])   <br>
               {  <br>
                   System.out.println(10 * 20 + "taiyari.com");  <br> 
                      System.out.println("taiyari.com" + 10 * 20);  <br>
               }  <br>
            } <br>
            
          </div>
          <p id="answer"> The output of the above code will be </p>
          <div class="result">
            200taiyari.com
           <br> taiyari.com200
          </div>
          <br>

          <h2 id="question">12)   What is the output of the following Java program?</h2> 
          <div class="program">
            class Test   <br>
            {  <br>
                public static void main (String args[])   <br>
                {  <br>
                    for(int i=0; 0; i++)   <br>
                    {  <br>
                        System.out.println("Hello Javatpoint");  <br>
                    }  <br>
                }  <br>
            }      
            
          </div>
          <p id="answer"> The above code will give the compile-time error because the for loop demands a boolean value in the second part and we are providing an integer value, i.e., 0. </p>
