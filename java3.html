          <h2 id="question">52)   What is the difference between static binding and dynamic binding?</h2>
            <p id="answer"> In case of the static binding, the type of the object is determined at compile-time whereas, in the dynamic binding, the type of the object is determined at runtime. <br> <br>
               <b> Static binding</b> </p>
               <div class="program">
                class Dog{  <br>

            <h2 id="question">53)   What is Java instanceOf operator?</h2>
              <p id="answer"> The instanceof in Java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type. It returns either true or false. If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has a null value, it returns false. Consider the following example.</p>
              <div class="program">
                class Simple1{  <br>
                  public static void main(String args[]){  <br>
                  Simple1 s=new Simple1();  <br>
                  System.out.println(s instanceof Simple1);//true  <br>
                  }  <br>
                 } <br>
                
              </div>
              <p id="answer"> The output of the above code will be </p>
              <div class="result">
                true
              </div>
              <br>
              <p id="answer">An object of subclass type is also a type of parent class. For example, if Dog extends Animal then object of Dog can be referred by either Dog or Animal class.</p>


              <h1 id="demo">Core Java - OOPs Concepts: Abstraction Interview Questions</h1>
            <h2 id="question">54)   What is the abstraction?</h2>
                <p id="answer"> Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. It displays just the essential things to the user and hides the internal information, for example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery. Abstraction enables you to focus on what the object does instead of how it does it. Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it. <br> <br>
                  In Java, there are two ways to achieve the abstraction.
                <ul id="subpoints">
                  <li >Abstract Class</li>
                  <li >Interface</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              
            <h2 id="question">55)   What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?</h2>
            <p id="answer"> Abstraction hides the implementation details whereas encapsulation wraps code and data into a single unit. </p>
             
            

            <h2 id="question">56)   What is the abstract class?</h2>
              <p id="answer"> A class that is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated. It can have abstract methods, non-abstract methods, constructors, and static methods. It can also have the final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method. Consider the following example.</p>
              <div class="program">
                abstract class Bike{  <br>
                  abstract void run();  <br>
                }  <br>
                class Honda4 extends Bike{  <br>
                void run(){System.out.println("running safely");}  <br>
                public static void main(String args[]){  <br>
                 Bike obj = new Honda4();  <br>
                 obj.run();  <br>
                }  <br>
                }   <br>
                
              </div>
              <p id="answer"> The output is </p>
              <div class="result">
                running safely
              </div>
              <br>
             
           <h2 id="question">57)   What is the interface?</h2>
                <p id="answer"> The interface is a blueprint for a class that has static constants and abstract methods. It can be used to achieve full abstraction and multiple inheritance. It is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship. It cannot be instantiated just like the abstract class. However, we need to implement it to define its methods. Since Java 8, we can have the default, static, and private methods in an interface.</p>
              
          <h2 id="question">58)  Can the Interface be final?</h2>
                  <p id="answer"> No, because methods of an interface are abstract by default, and we can not use static and abstract together..</p>
                  
                

                  
          <h2 id="question">59)   Can the Interface be final?</h3>
           <p id="answer"> No, because an interface needs to be implemented by the other class and if it is final, it can't be implemented by any class.</p>
          

          <h2 id="question">60)   How to make a read-only class in Java?</h2>   
          <p id="answer">A class can be made read-only by making all of the fields private. The read-only class will have only getter methods which return the private property of the class to the main method. We cannot modify this property because there is no setter method available in the class. Consider the following example.</p>       
          <div class="program">
            public class Student{    <br>
              //private data member    <br>
              private String college="AKG";  <br>  
              //getter method for college    <br>
              public String getCollege(){    <br>
              return college;    <br>
              }   <br> 
              }  <br>
            
          </div>
          <h2 id="question">61)   How to make a write-only class in Java?</h2>   
          <p id="answer">A class can be made write-only by making all of the fields private. The write-only class will have only setter methods which set the value passed from the main method to the private fields. We cannot read the properties of the class because there is no getter method in this class. Consider the following example.</p>       
          <div class="program">
            public class Student{    <br>
              //private data member    <br>
              private String college;    <br>
              //getter method for college   <br> 
              public void setCollege(String college){    <br>
              this.college=college;    <br>
              }   <br> 
              }  <br>
            
          </div>
         

          <h2 id="question">62)   What are the advantages of Encapsulation in Java?</h2> 
        
          <p id="answer"> There are the following advantages of Encapsulation in Java
            <ul id="subpoints">
              <li>By providing only the setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only. In other words, you can skip the getter or setter methods.</li>
              <li>It provides you the control over the data. Suppose you want to set the value of id which should be greater than 100 only, you can write the logic inside the setter method. You can write the logic not to store the negative numbers in the setter method.</li>
              <li>It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.</li>
              <li>The encapsulate class is easy to test. So, it is better for unit testing.</li>
              <li>The standard IDE's are providing the facility to generate the getters and setters. So, it is easy and fast to create an encapsulated class in Java.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h1 id="demo">Java: Exception Handling Interview Questions</h1>
          <p id="answer">There is given a list of exception handling interview questions with answers. If you know any exception handling interview question, kindly post it in the comment section.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2 id="question">63)   How many types of exception can occur in a Java program?</h2>
              <p id="answer"> There are mainly two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked. Here, an error is considered as the unchecked exception. According to Oracle, there are three types of exceptions: <br> 
              <ul id="subpoints">
                <li ><b>Checked Exception:</b> Checked exceptions are the one which are checked at compile-time. For example, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException, etc.</li>
                <li ><b>Unchecked Exception:</b> Unchecked exceptions are the one which are handled at runtime because they can not be checked at compile-time. For example, ArithmaticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc.</li>
                <li><b>Error:</b> Error cause the program to exit since they are not recoverable. For Example, OutOfMemoryError, AssertionError, etc. </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            
          <h2 id="question">64)    What is Exception Handling??</h2>
          <p id="answer">Exception Handling is a mechanism that is used to handle runtime errors. It is used primarily to handle checked exceptions. Exception handling maintains the normal flow of the program. There are mainly two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked. Here, the error is considered as the unchecked exception. </p>
           
          

          <h2 id="question">65)   Explain the hierarchy of Java Exception classes?</h2>
            <p id="answer"> The java.lang.Throwable class is the root class of Java Exception hierarchy which is inherited by two subclasses: Exception and Error. A hierarchy of Java Exception classes are given below:</p>
            <img src="img/throwable.png" alt="" style="margin-top: 20px; background: rgb(77, 76, 76);"> 
           
         <h2 id="question">66)   What is the difference between Checked Exception and Unchecked Exception?</h2>
              <p id="answer"> 
                <ol id="subpoints">
                  <li>Checked Exception <br>
                  <p id="answer">The classes that extend Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions, e.g., IOException, SQLException, etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.</p></li>
                  <li>Unchecked Exception <br>
                    <p id="answer">The classes that extend RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions, e.g., ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time.</p></li>
                </ol>
              </p>
            
        <h2 id="question">67)  What is finally block?</h2>
                <p id="answer"> The "finally" block is used to execute the important code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not. In other words, we can say that finally block is the block which is always executed. Finally block follows try or catch block. If you don't handle the exception, before terminating the program, JVM runs finally block, (if any). The finally block is mainly used to place the cleanup code such as closing a file or closing a connection. Here, we must know that for each try block there can be zero or more catch blocks, but only one finally block. The finally block will not be executed if program exits(either by calling System.exit() or by causing a fatal error that causes the process to abort).</p>

     <h1 id="demo">Garbage Collection Interview Questions</h1>       
        <h2 id="question">68)What is Garbage Collection?  </h2>
         <p id="answer"> Garbage collection is a process of reclaiming the unused runtime objects. It is performed for memory management. In other words, we can say that It is the process of removing unused objects from the memory to free up space and make this space available for Java Virtual Machine. Due to garbage collection java gives 0 as output to a variable whose value is not set, i.e., the variable has been defined but not initialized. For this purpose, we were using free() function in the C language and delete() in C++. In Java, it is performed automatically. So, java provides better memory management.</p>  
        


        <h2 id="question">69)   What is the purpose of the finalize() method?</h2>   
        <p id="answer">The finalize() method is invoked just before the object is garbage collected. It is used to perform cleanup processing. The Garbage collector of JVM collects only those objects that are created by new keyword. So if you have created an object without new, you can use the finalize method to perform cleanup processing (destroying remaining objects). The cleanup processing is the process to free up all the resources, network which was previously used and no longer needed. It is essential to remember that it is not a reserved keyword, finalize method is present in the object class hence it is available in every class as object class is the superclass of every class in java. Here, we must note that neither finalization nor garbage collection is guaranteed. Consider the following example.</p>
