            <h2 id="question">4)  What is PEP 8?   </h2>
            <p id="answer">PEP 8 is defined as a document that helps us to provide the guidelines on how to write the Python code. It was written by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw and Nick Coghlan in 2001.

               <br><br> It stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and its major task is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.</p>
            
              
            <h2 id="question">5)   Explain Python Functions?</h2>
            <p id="answer"> A function is a section of the program or a block of code that is written once and can be executed whenever required in the program. A function is a block of self-contained statements which has a valid name, parameters list, and body. Functions make programming more functional and modular to perform modular tasks. Python provides several built-in functions to complete tasks and also allows a user to create new functions as well.
                <br><br>
                There are two types of functions:</p>
                <ul id="subpoints">
                    <li>Built-In Functions: copy(), len(), count() are the some built-in functions.</li>
                    <li>User-defined Functions: Functions which are defined by a user known as user-defined functions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p id="answer"> <b>Example:</b>  A general syntax of user defined function is given below.</p>
                <div class="result">
                    def function_name(parameters list):   <br>
                    #--- statements---   <br>
                    return a_value  <br>
                  </div>
            

            <h2 id="question">6)   What is Python's parameter passing mechanism?</h2>
              <p id="answer">There are two parameters passing mechanism in Python:</p>
              <ul id="subpoints">
                  <li>Pass by references</li>
                  <li>Pass by value</li>
              </ul>
              <p id="answer">By default, all the parameters (arguments) are passed "by reference" to the functions. Thus, if you change the value of the parameter within a function, the change is reflected in the calling function as well. It indicates the original variable. For example, if a variable is declared as a = 10, and passed to a function where it?s value is modified to a = 20. Both the variables denote to the same value.</p>
              <img src="img/python-parameter-passing-mechanism.png" alt="" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 70px;">
              <p id="answer">The pass by value is that whenever we pass the arguments to the function only values pass to the function, no reference passes to the function. It makes it immutable that means not changeable. Both variables hold the different values, and original value persists even after modifying in the function.</p>
              <img src="img/python-parameter-passing-mechani.png" alt="" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 70px;">
              <p id="answer">Python has a default argument concept which helps to call a method using an arbitrary number of arguments.</p>
             
           <h2 id="question">7)   How to overload constructors or methods in Python? </h2>
                <p id="answer"> Python's constructor: _init__ () is the first method of a class. Whenever we try to instantiate an object __init__() is automatically invoked by python to initialize members of an object. We can't overload constructors or methods in Python. It shows an error if we try to overload.
                </p>
                <div class="program">
                    class student:   <br>
                    def __init__(self,name):   <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;   self.name = name   <br>
                    def __init__(self, name, email):  <br> 
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;   self.name = name  <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;   self.email = email  <br> 
                       <br>
                # This line will generate an error  <br>
                #st = student("rahul")  <br>
                  <br>
                # This line will call the second constructor  <br>
                st = student("rahul", "rahul@gmail.com")  <br>
                print(st.name)  <br>
                Output:  <br>
                rahul  <br>
                    
                  </div>
              
          <h2 id="question">8) What is swapcase() function in the Python? </h2>
                  <p id="answer">It is a string's function which converts all uppercase characters into lowercase and vice versa. It is used to alter the existing case of the string. This method creates a copy of the string which contains all the characters in the swap case. If the string is in lowercase, it generates a small case string and vice versa. It automatically ignores all the non-alphabetic characters. See an example below.<br>
                    <div class="program">
                        string = "IT IS IN LOWERCASE."  <br>
                        print(string.swapcase())  <br><br>
                          
                        string = "it is in uppercase."  <br>
                        print(string.swapcase())  <br>
                        
                      </div>
                      <div class="result">
                        it is in lowercase. <br>
                        IT IS IN UPPERCASE.  <br>
                      </div>

                  
          <h2 id="question">9)   How to remove whitespaces from a string in Python?</h3>
                    <p id="answer"> To remove the whitespaces and trailing spaces from the string, Python providies strip([str]) built-in function. This function returns a copy of the string after removing whitespaces if present. Otherwise returns original string.</p>
                    <div class="program">
                        string = "&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javatpoint &nbsp; "  <br>
                        string2 = " &nbsp;&nbsp;   javatpoint   &nbsp;&nbsp;     "  <br>
                        string3 = " &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   javatpoint"  <br>
                        print(string)  <br>
                        print(string2)  <br>
                        print(string3)  <br>
                        print("After stripping all have placed in a sequence:")  <br>
                        print(string.strip())  <br>
                        print(string2.strip())  <br>
                        print(string3.strip())   <br>
                      </div>
                      <div class="result">
                        javatpoint  <br>
                        &nbsp;     javatpoint    <br>     
                        &nbsp;   &nbsp;     javatpoint  <br>
                      </div>
          

          <h2 id="question">10)   Give an example of shuffle() method?</h2>          
          <p id="answer">This method shuffles the given string or an array. It randomizes the items in the array. This method is present in the random module. So, we need to import it and then we can call the function. It shuffles elements each time when the function calls and produces different output. </p>
          <div class="program">
            import random  <br><br>
  
            list = [12,25,15,65,58,14,5,];  <br>
            print(list)  <br>
            random.shuffle(list)  <br>
            print ("Reshuffled list : \n",  list)   <br>
          </div>
          <div class="result">
            [12, 25, 15, 65, 58, 14, 5]  <br> <br>
            Reshuffled list : <br><br>
             [58, 15, 5, 65, 12, 14, 25]  <br>
          </div>
           
          <h2 id="question">11) What is tuple in Python?</h2> 
          <p id="answer">A tuple is a built-in data collection type. It allows us to store values in a sequence. It is immutable, so no change is reflected in the original data. It uses () brackets rather than [] square brackets to create a tuple. We cannot remove any element but can find in the tuple. We can use indexing to get elements. It also allows traversing elements in reverse order by using negative indexing. Tuple supports various methods like max(), sum(), sorted(), Len() etc. <br><br>

            To create a tuple, we can declare it as below. </p>
            <div class="program">
                # Declaring tuple  <br><br>
                tup = (2,4,6,8)  <br>
                # Displaying value  <br>
                print(tup)  <br>
                  <br>
                # Displaying Single value  <br>
                print(tup[2])   <br>
              </div>
              <div class="result">
                (2, 4, 6, 8) <br> <br>
                    6 <br>
              </div>

          <h2 id="question">12) Which are the file related libraries/modules in Python?</h2> 
          <p id="answer">The Python provides libraries/modules that enable you to manipulate text files and binary files on the file system. It helps to create files, update their contents, copy, and delete files. The libraries are os, os.path, and shutil. <br>
<br>
            Here, os and os.path - modules include a function for accessing the filesystem <br><br>
            
            while shutil - module enables you to copy and delete the files. </p>

          <h2 id="question">13)  What are the different file processing modes supported by Python? </h2>

          
          <p id="answer"> Python provides three modes to open files. The read-only, write-only, read-write and append mode. 'r' is used to open a file in read-only mode, 'w' is used to open a file in write-only mode, 'rw' is used to open in reading and write mode, 'a' is used to open a file in append mode. If the mode is not specified, by default file opens in read-only mode. </p>
          <ul id="subpoints">
              <li>Read-only mode : Open a file for reading. It is the default mode.</li>
              <li>Write-only mode: Open a file for writing. If the file contains data, data would be lost. Other a new file is created.</li>
              <li>Read-Write mode: Open a file for reading, write mode. It means updating mode.</li>
              <li>Append mode: Open for writing, append to the end of the file, if the file exists.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="question">14) What is an operator in Python?</h2> 
          <p id="answer"> An operator is a particular symbol which is used on some values and produces an output as a result. An operator works on operands. Operands are numeric literals or variables which hold some values. Operators can be unary, binary or ternary. An operator which require a single operand known as a unary operator, which require two operands known as a binary operator and which require three operands is called ternary operator.

            3 + 2 = 5 # Binary  <br>
            Here, "+" and "=" are operators.  <br>
            a, b = 2,5  <br>
            # Assign minimum value using ternary operator   <br>
            min = a if a < b else b  <br>
            print(min)   <br>

          <h2 id="question">15)  What are the different types of operators in Python? </h2> 
          <p id="answer">Python uses a rich set of operators to perform a variety of operations. Some individual operators like membership and identity operators are not so familiar but allow to perform operations.</p>
          <ul id="subpoints">
              <li>Arithmetic OperatorsRelational Operators</li>
              <li>Assignment Operators</li>
              <li>Logical Operators</li>
              <li>Membership Operators</li>
              <li>Identity Operators</li>
              <li>Bitwise Operators</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="question">16)   Is Python interpreted language?</h2> 
          <p id="answer">Python is an interpreted language. The Python language program runs directly from the source code. It converts the source code into an intermediate language code, which is again translated into machine language that has to be executed. <br><br>

            Unlike Java or C, Python does not require compilation before execution. </p>
         


          <h2 id="question">17) How is memory managed in Python? </h2> 
          <p id="answer"> Memory is managed in Python by the following way: </p>
          <ul id="subpoints">
              <li>The Python memory is managed by a Python private heap space. All the objects and data structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have permission to access this private heap.</li>
              <li>We can easily allocate heap space for Python objects by the Python memory manager. The core API gives access of some tools to the programmer for coding purpose.</li>
              <li>Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycle all the unused memory and frees the memory for the heap space.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="question">18)  What are the rules for a local and global variable in Python? </h2> 
          <p id="answer">In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are called implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a new value anywhere within the function's body, it's assumed to be a local. If a variable is ever assigned a new value inside the function, the variable is implicitly local, and we need to declare it as 'global' explicitly. To make a variable globally, we need to declare it by using global keyword. Local variables are accessible within local body only. Global variables are accessible anywhere in the program, and any function can access and modify its value.</p>
         

          <h2 id="question">19)  What is the namespace in Python?</h2> 
          <p id="answer">The namespace is a fundamental idea to structure and organize the code that is more useful in large projects. However, it could be a bit difficult concept to grasp if you're new to programming. Hence, we tried to make namespaces just a little easier to understand. <br><br>

            A namespace is defined as a simple system to control the names in a program. It ensures that names are unique and won't lead to any conflict. <br><br>
            
            Also, Python implements namespaces in the form of dictionaries and maintains name-to-object mapping where names act as keys and the objects as values.</p>

          <h2 id="question">20)   What are iterators in Python?</h2> 
          <p id="answer"> In Python, iterators are used to iterate a group of elements, containers like a list. Iterators are the collection of items, and it can be a list, tuple, or a dictionary. Python iterator implements __itr__ and next() method to iterate the stored elements. In Python, we generally use loops to iterate over the collections (list, tuple).<br>
            </p>


          <h2 id="question">21)  What is a generator in Python? </h2> 
          <p id="answer">In Python, the generator is a way that specifies how to implement iterators. It is a normal function except that it yields expression in the function. It does not implements __itr__ and next() method and reduce other overheads as well. <br><br>

            If a function contains at least a yield statement, it becomes a generator. The yield keyword pauses the current execution by saving its states and then resume from the same when required.
            
            </p>


          <h2 id="question">22)   What is slicing in Python?</h2> 
          <p id="answer">Slicing is a mechanism used to select a range of items from sequence type like list, tuple, and string. It is beneficial and easy to get elements from a range by using slice way. It requires a : (colon) which separates the start and end index of the field. All the data collection types List or tuple allows us to use slicing to fetch elements. Although we can get elements by specifying an index, we get only single element whereas using slicing we can get a group of elements. </p>

          <h2 id="question">23)   What is a dictionary in Python?</h2> 
          <p id="answer">The Python dictionary is a built-in data type. It defines a one-to-one relationship between keys and values. Dictionaries contain a pair of keys and their corresponding values. It stores elements in key and value pairs. The keys are unique whereas values can be duplicate. The key accesses the dictionary elements. <br><br>

            Keys index dictionaries. <br><br>
            
            Let's take an example. <br><br>
            
            The following example contains some keys Country Hero & Cartoon. Their corresponding values are India, Modi, and Rahul respectively.</p>
            <div class="program">
                >>> dict = {'Country': 'India', 'Hero': 'Modi', 'Cartoon': 'Rahul'}  <br>
                >>>print dict[Country]  <br>
                India  <br>
                >>>print dict[Hero]  <br>
                Modi  <br>
                >>>print dict[Cartoon]  <br>
                Rahul <br>
              </div>

          <h2 id="question">24)   What is a negative index in Python?</h2> 
          <p id="answer">Python sequences are accessible using an index in positive and negative numbers. For example, 0 is the first positive index, 1 is the second positive index and so on. For negative indexes -1 is the last negative index, -2 is the second last negative index and so on. <br><br>

            Index traverses from left to right and increases by one until end of the list. <br><br>
            
            Negative index traverse from right to left and iterate one by one till the start of the list. A negative index is used to traverse the elements into reverse order. </p>

          <h2 id="question">25)   What is pickling and unpickling in Python?</h2> 
          <p id="answer"> The Python pickle is defined as a module which accepts any Python object and converts it into a string representation. It dumps the Python object into a file using the dump function; this process is called pickling. <br><br>

            The process of retrieving the original Python objects from the stored string representation is called as Unpickling. </p>

          <h2 id="question">26)   Which programming language is a good choice between Java and Python??</h2> 
          <p id="answer"> Java and Python both are object-oriented programming languages. Let's compare both on some criteria given below: </p>
          <table id="t01">
            <tr>

            <td>Average</td>
            <td>Very Good</td>
         </tr>
          </table>
        

          <h2 id="question">27)   What are the differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x?</h2> 
          <p id="answer">Python 2.x is an older version of Python. Python 3.x is newer and latest version. Python 2.x is legacy now. Python 3.x is the present and future of this language. <br><br>

            The most visible difference between Python2 and Python3 is in print statement (function). In Python 2, it looks like print "Hello", and in Python 3, it is print ("Hello"). <br><br>
            
            String in Python2 is ASCII implicitly, and in Python3 it is Unicode. <br><br>
            
            The xrange() method has removed from Python 3 version. A new keyword as is introduced in Error handling. </p>
         

          <h2 id="question">28)   How Python does Compile-time and Run-time code checking?</h2> 
          <p id="answer">In Python, some amount of coding is done at compile time, but most of the checking such as type, name, etc. are postponed until code execution. Consequently, if the Python code references a user-defined function that does not exist, the code will compile successfully. The Python code will fail only with an exception when the code execution path does not exist.</p>

          <h2 id="question">29)   What is the shortest method to open a text file and display its content? </h2> 
          <p id="answer"> The shortest way to open a text file is by using "with" command in the following manner:</p>
          <div class="program">
            with open("file-name", "r") as fp:   <br>
            fileData = fp.read()  <br>
            #to print the contents of the file   <br>
            print(fileData)    <br>
          </div>

          <h2 id="question">30)  What is the usage of enumerate () function in Python?</h2> 
          <p id="answer">The enumerate() function is used to iterate through the sequence and retrieve the index position and its corresponding value at the same time.</p>
          <div class="program">
            For i,v in enumerate(['Python','Java','C++']):   <br>
            print(i,v)  <br>
            0 Python  <br>
            1 Java   <br>
            2 C++  <br>
            # enumerate using an index sequence  <br>
            for count, item in enumerate(['Python','Java','C++'], 10):  <br>
          </div>


          <h2 id="question">31)   Give the output of this example: A[3] if A=[1,4,6,7,9,66,4,94]. </h2> 
          <p id="answer"> Since indexing starts from zero, an element present at 3rd index is 7. So, the output is 7.</p>

          <h2 id="question">32)   What is lambda function in Python? </h2> 
          <p id="answer"> The anonymous function in python is a function that is defined without a name. The normal functions are defined using a keyword "def", whereas, the anonymous functions are defined using the lambda function. The anonymous functions are also called as lambda functions. </p>

          <h2 id="question">33)   Why do lambda forms in Python not have the statements?</h2> 
          <p id="answer"> Because it is used to make the new function object and return them in runtime.</p>

          <h2 id="question">34)   How can you convert a number to string?</h2> 
          <p id="answer">We can use the inbuilt function str() to convert a number into a string. If you want an octal or hexadecimal representation, we can use the oct() or hex() inbuilt function.</p>

          <h2 id="question">35)   Mention the rules for local and global variables in Python? </h2> 
          <p id="answer"><b> Local variables:</b> If a new value is assigned by a variable within the function's body, it is assumed to be local. <br>
<br>
            <b>Global variables:</b> These are the variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global.</p>
